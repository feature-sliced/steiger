# steiger

## 0.5.0

This release brings a new configuration format! Now you can disable rules only in certain parts of the project, pass options to rules, and set the severity for rules. Also this configuration format allows you to pass third-party plugins and even write your own rules.

Example:

```javascript
// ./steiger.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'steiger'
import fsd from '@feature-sliced/steiger-plugin' // you need to install separately this now

export default defineConfig([
  ...fsd.configs.recommended,
  {
    // disable the `public-api` rule for files in the Shared layer
    files: ['./src/shared/**'],
    rules: {
      'fsd/public-api': 'off', // can also be 'warn'
    },
  },
])
```

Migrating from the old config is easy, refer to the short [migration guide](../../MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) that we created. It even has an automatic codemod :)

---

This release includes plugin support, and here's how you can write your own! For more inspiration, check out the FSD plugin (`./packages/steiger-plugin-fsd` in this repo).

```ts
import { enableAllRules, createPlugin, createConfigs } from '@steiger/toolkit'

const plugin = createPlugin({
  meta: {
    name: 'my-awesome-plugin',
    version: '1.0.0',
  },
  ruleDefinitions: [
    {
      name: 'my/rule-1',
      check(root) {
        /* â€¦ */
      },
    },
  ],
})

const configs = createConfigs({
  recommended: enableAllRules(plugin),
})

export default {
  plugin,
  configs,
}
```
