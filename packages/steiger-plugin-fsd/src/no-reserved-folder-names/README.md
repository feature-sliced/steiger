# `no-reserved-folder-names`

Forbid subfolders in segments that have the same name as other conventional segments. For example, `shared/ui/lib` is a folder inside `shared/ui` that has a name of a conventional segment `lib`, which might cause confusion about the segment structure.

This rule forbids the following names:

- `ui`
- `model`
- `api`
- `lib`
- `config`

Examples of project structures that pass this rule:

```
📂 shared
  📂 ui
    📄 index.ts
  📂 lib
    📄 index.ts
📂 entities
  📂 user
    📂 ui
    📂 model
    📄 index.ts
📂 pages
  📂 home
    📂 ui
    📄 index.ts
```

Examples of project structures that fail this rule:

```
📂 shared
  📂 ui
    📄 index.ts
    📂 lib // ❌
      📄 someUiFunction.ts
    📂 @x // ❌
      📄 justForFun.ts
📂 entities
  📂 user
    📂 ui
    📂 model
    📄 index.ts
📂 pages
  📂 home
    📂 ui
    📄 index.ts
```

## Rationale

While segment names aren't strictly regulated by Feature-Sliced Design, there is a number of conventional segment names that are widely recognized from project to project. Seeing these folder names might lead people to believe that they are looking at a slice, while in reality, they are looking at a subfolder of a slice. To maintain predictable project structure, we disallow naming internal folders with conventional segment names.
