# `no-cross-imports`

This rule forbids cross-imports between slices on the same layer. This is in accordance to the import rule on layers:

> A module in a slice can only import other slices when they are located on layers strictly below.

> https://feature-sliced.design/docs/reference/layers#import-rule-on-layers

Example of a project structure that passes this rule (arrows signify imports):

```mermaid
flowchart BT
  subgraph entities
    subgraph entities/user[user]
      subgraph entities/user/ui[ui]
        entities/user/ui/UserAvatar.tsx[UserAvatar.tsx]
      end
      entities/user/index.ts[index.ts]
    end
    subgraph entities/product[product]
      subgraph entities/product/ui[ui]
        entities/product/ui/ProductCard.tsx[ProductCard.tsx]
      end
      entities/product/index.ts[index.ts]
    end
  end

  subgraph shared
    subgraph shared/ui[ui]
      shared/ui/index.ts[index.ts]
    end
  end

  entities/user/ui/UserAvatar.tsx --> shared/ui/index.ts
  entities/product/ui/ProductCard.tsx --> shared/ui/index.ts
```

```mermaid
flowchart BT
  subgraph entities
    subgraph entities/user[user]
      subgraph entities/user/at-x[@x]
        entities/user/at-x/product.ts[product.ts]
      end
      subgraph entities/user/ui[ui]
        entities/user/ui/UserAvatar.tsx[UserAvatar.tsx]
      end
      entities/user/index.ts[index.ts]
    end
    subgraph entities/product[product]
      subgraph entities/product/ui[ui]
        entities/product/ui/ProductCard.tsx[ProductCard.tsx]
      end
      entities/product/index.ts[index.ts]
    end
  end

  entities/user/ui/UserAvatar.tsx --> shared/ui/index.ts
  entities/product/ui/ProductCard.tsx --> entities/user/at-x/product.ts
```

Examples of project structures that fail this rule:

```mermaid

  subgraph entities
    subgraph entities/user[user]
      subgraph entities/user/ui[ui]
        entities/user/ui/UserAvatar.tsx[UserAvatar.tsx]
      end
      entities/user/index.ts[index.ts]
    end
    subgraph entities/product[product]
      subgraph entities/product/ui[ui]
        entities/product/ui/ProductCard.tsx[ProductCard.tsx]
      end
      entities/product/index.ts[index.ts]
    end
  end

  entities/user/ui/UserAvatar.tsx --> shared/ui/index.ts
  entities/product/ui/ProductCard.tsx --❌--> entities/user/index.ts
```

```mermaid
flowchart BT
  subgraph features
    subgraph features/auth[auth]
      subgraph features/auth/ui[ui]
        features/auth/ui/LoginForm.tsx[LoginForm.tsx]
      end
      features/auth/index.ts[index.ts]
    end
    subgraph features/registration[registration]
      subgraph features/registration/ui[ui]
        features/registration/ui/RegistrationForm.tsx[RegistrationForm.tsx]
      end
      features/registration/index.ts[index.ts]
    end
  end

  features/auth/ui/LoginForm.tsx --> shared/ui/index.ts
  features/registration/ui/RegistrationForm.tsx --❌--> features/auth/ui/LoginForm.tsx
```

## Rationale

This is one of the main rules of Feature-Sliced Design, it ensures low coupling and predictability in refactoring.
